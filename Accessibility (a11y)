Use appropriate HTML elements (<button>, <header>, <nav>, etc.) for better accessibility.
ARIA Attributes:

Use ARIA roles and attributes to enhance accessibility where necessary.
Keyboard Navigation:

Ensure all interactive elements are reachable and operable via keyboard.
Alt Text for Images:

Provide descriptive alt attributes for images.
Focus Management:

Manage focus appropriately, especially in modals and dynamic content.
Color Contrast:

Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and backgrounds.
