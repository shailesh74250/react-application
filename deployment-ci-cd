Automating deployment and continuous integration ensures that your application is reliably built, tested, and deployed.

Best Practices
Use CI/CD Pipelines:

Automate testing, building, and deployment processes using tools like GitHub Actions, Travis CI, or Jenkins.
Environment Variables:

Manage configuration using environment variables for different environments (development, staging, production).
Optimized Builds:

Generate optimized production builds using tools like Webpack or leveraging frameworks' built-in optimizations.
Monitor Deployments:

Use monitoring tools to track application performance and errors post-deployment.
Rollback Strategies:

Implement strategies to revert to previous stable versions in case of deployment failures.
